## IMPORTANT NOTICE
IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY TAKING CSCI201, YOU MAY NOT COPY OR REFERENCE MY CODE IN ANY WAY. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

### Less important notice: 
You can find the assignment requirements in the pdf file. I'll be the first to admit that my code is quite rushed and has numerous bugs in it. (For example, not checking user input, not handling certain exceptions, etc.) However, I had extremely limited time and this was an MVP of sorts. Literally worked til the last 10 minutes before due. Anyway, feel free to nitpick my code and submit an issue.
